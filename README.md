I followed this Svelte todo [tutorial](https://areknawo.com/making-a-todo-app-in-svelte/).

The main code is in [src/App.svelte](src/App.svelte)


Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then to start app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
